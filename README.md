This is a simple portfolio website showcasing my projects and skills.
This project is a personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes sections for displaying projects, skills, and contact information.

To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
You can also explore the CSS files in the `app.css` folder and the JavaScript file in the `app.js` folder to understand how the website is styled and functions.
